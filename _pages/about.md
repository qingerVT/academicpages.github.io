I am a Applied Scientist at Amazon Health AI. Before joining Amazon, I was a research scientist at Facebook AI Applied Research working on neural machine translation and NLP.

My previous works lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on developing diverse models in solving structured prediciton problems. 

Now, I am excited about the developing intelligent agents that are able to acquire knowledge and adapt to novel enviroments quickly, especially though natural language interactions.
* Cross-modal transfer learning
* Symbolic representation
* Weakly supervised learning with natural languages
