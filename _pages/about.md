I am a research scientist at Facebook AI Applied Research working on neural machine translation and NLP


Research 
======
My previous works lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on developing diverse models in solving structured prediciton problems. 

Now, I am excited about the developing intelligent agents what are able to acquire knowledge and adapt to novel enviroment quickly like humans.
