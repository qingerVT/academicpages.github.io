I am a research scientist at Facebook AI Applied Research working on neural machine translation and NLP

Form 2013-2017, I was a research assistant at the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. I am advised by Dr. Dhruv Batra.

Form 2016-2017, I was a research intern at Institute of Deep Learning, Baidu Research, working with Baidu Distinguished Scientist Wei Xu and research scientist Yi Yang, on meta-learning through natural languages.

From 2012-2013, I was a Research Assistant at Computational Bioinformatics and Bio-imaging Laboratory(CBIL) working on Genome/pathway-wide detection of interacting genomic/epigenetic loci and environment variables.

I received my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from Tianjin University with a minor in Finance from Nankai University in July 2009, and received my Master degree in Electrical Engineering from Tianjin University advised by Prof. Huaxiang Wang in July 2012.

Research 
======
My previous works lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on developing diverse models in solving structured prediciton problems. 

Now, I am excited about the developing intelligent agents what are able to acquire knowledge and adapt to novel enviroment quickly like humans.
